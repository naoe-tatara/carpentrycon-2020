## What is CodeRefinery

[RB drafts this, 5 minutes]

- What is CodeRefinery?
- How does it relate to Carpentries?
- Lightning slide-deck (3 slides, link to web)
- Audience: our audience is not mostly pure beginners
- Ask Question via HackMD:
  - Is there a need for more intermediate/advanced Carpentries-style
    material for learners who have completed a basic Carpentries
    training?
  - What topics/courses are needed?

## A vision of reaching many people at once

[RD drafts this, 2+10+3 minutes]

- What was a Mega-Workshop? and why?
- Why you would want to - the promise of technology reaching everyone.
- Why you need a vision (Mega-Coderefinery vs HPC kickstart)
- You can get even *more* out of it
- Question to audience via breakout room, answers in HackMD:
  - How can large be more inclusive?  How is it less?
  - What technical obstacles does it have?
- Do we discuss results in main room?

[AF drafts this, 2 minutes]

## Collaborative notes

- Use of HackMD for collection of Q&A regarding lesson contents
<ul style="list-style-type:' \002B \0020 \0020'">
  <li> It keeps record of Q&A so that it is possible to review afterwards.</li>
  <li> Main flow is not disrupted.</li>
  <li> Stable most of the time with 50-100 users (depending on the edit history length).</li>
</ul>

- For short communications for more practical questions, we used Zoom chat function.

## Future outlook and Q&A session

[RB drafts this, 5-10 minutes]

---

<!-- 1-2 slides but q&a and "discussion" via hackmd -->

- Continue with online workshops even later - this is not "replacement to
  in-person" but much better in some ways
- Does this work in all audience types? Diversity, tech background.
- Encourage and accept lurkers more (better experience when streaming).
- How can we make a federated model via the stream? We don't know yet.
